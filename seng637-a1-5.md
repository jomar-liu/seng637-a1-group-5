# Introduction

In this lab, we explored various testing methods applied to an ATM system. Specifically, the lab focused on exploratory testing,manual functional (scripted) testing, and regression testing. Prior to this, exploratory testing was understood as an approach where software testers actively explore the system without predefined scripts, discovering defects as they interact with the system in real-time. Manual functional testing, on the other hand, was seen as a more structured, pre-scripted approach, aiming to validate system functions according to predefined criteria. Regression testing was anticipated as a means to ensure that previously identified bugs are fixed and that new changes don't negatively affect the system.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The exploratory testing phase was structured around the idea of actively exploring different transaction functionalities within the ATM system. We freely explored the system's behavior with minimal guidelines, which allowed for a broad coverage of the system's features, ranging from basic operations like withdrawals,fund transfers, balance inquiries and deposits to more complex scenarios like handling invalid card entries. Each group member was assigned a specific area to focus on, ensuring a wide spread of testing across the ATM system.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

The team was divided into two pairs, with four members in total. Within each pair, one member conducted the testing while the other reviewed and analyzed the results. Peer reviews were conducted to evaluate defect reports. Regression testing was conducted individually, with each member responsible for a similar number of defect reports and scripted test cases to ensure an even distribution of effort.
