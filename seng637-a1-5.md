# Introduction

In this lab, we explored various testing methods applied to an ATM system. Specifically, the lab focused on exploratory testing,manual functional (scripted) testing, and regression testing. Prior to this, exploratory testing was understood as an approach where software testers actively explore the system without predefined scripts, discovering defects as they interact with the system in real-time. Manual functional testing, on the other hand, was seen as a more structured, pre-scripted approach, aiming to validate system functions according to predefined criteria. Regression testing was anticipated as a means to ensure that previously identified bugs are fixed and that new changes don't negatively affect the system.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The exploratory testing phase was structured around the idea of actively exploring different transaction functionalities within the ATM system. We freely explored the system's behavior with minimal guidelines, which allowed for a broad coverage of the system's features, ranging from basic operations like withdrawals,fund transfers, balance inquiries and deposits to more complex scenarios like handling invalid card entries. Each group member was assigned a specific area to focus on, ensuring a wide spread of testing across the ATM system.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Exploratory testing allowed us to leverage the creativity to uncover defects that might not have been anticipated by manual functional (scripted) testing. This method proved highly effective for catching edge cases and system behaviours under non-standard conditions. For instance, a defect was found where the system displayed "insufficient cash available" despite the balance not being exceeded during a withdrawal request.

In contrast, manual functional testing followed a set of predefined test scripts, focusing on validating specific functionalities as outlined in the test cases in appendix C. This included testing operations like session,system startup and shutdown,fund transfer,withdrawals,invalid pin extensions, and deposits based on expected inputs and outcomes. The advantage of manual functional testing is its repeatability, which ensures that each functionality is thoroughly checked against a fixed criterion. However, it lacks the flexibility of exploratory testing, which can uncover issues that scripted tests might overlook.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

Peer reviews played a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy of defect reports and the thoroughness of the testing process. Each defect identified by one tester was reviewed by another to verify its validity and impact. For instance, the issue regarding the system displaying an incorrect receipt after a transfer was flagged, and its investigation ensured that the underlying issue with transaction recording was noted

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

The team was divided into two pairs, with four members in total. Within each pair, one member conducted the testing while the other reviewed and analyzed the results. Peer reviews were conducted to evaluate defect reports. Regression testing was conducted individually, with each member responsible for a similar number of defect reports and scripted test cases to ensure an even distribution of effort.
