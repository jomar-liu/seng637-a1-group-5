# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

The team was divided into two pairs, with four members in total. Within each pair, one member conducted the testing while the other reviewed and analyzed the results. Peer reviews were conducted to evaluate defect reports. Regression testing was conducted individually, with each member responsible for a similar number of defect reports and scripted test cases to ensure an even distribution of effort.
